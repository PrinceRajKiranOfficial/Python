# Naming Conventions in Programming

Naming conventions are important to make code more readable and maintainable. Two commonly used styles are **PascalCase** and **camelCase**.

## PascalCase
- In **PascalCase**, the first letter of **every word** is capitalized.
- Commonly used for defining **classes**.

**Example:**
```python
class HelloPython:
    pass
```

✅ Words: `Hello` + `Python` → `HelloPython`

---

## camelCase
- In **camelCase**, the **first word** starts with a lowercase letter, and the **subsequent words** start with uppercase letters.
- Commonly used for defining **functions** and **variables**.

**Example:**
```python
def helloPython():
    return "Hello from function"

myVariableName = "This is camelCase"
```

✅ Words: `hello` + `Python` → `helloPython`

---
✨ **Summary**: Use **PascalCase** for classes and **camelCase** for variables and functions to follow clean coding standards.
