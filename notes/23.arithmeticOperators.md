## Arithmetic Operators in Python

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations between numeric values. Below is a summary of the main arithmetic operators in Python, along with examples and their results.

| Operator | Name           | Example   | Result |
|----------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| `+`      | Addition       | `10 + 5`  | `15`   |
| `-`      | Subtraction    | `10 - 5`  | `5`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `10 * 5`  | `50`   |
| `/`      | Division       | `10 / 5`  | `2.0`  |
| `//`     | Floor Division | `10 // 3` | `3`    |
| `%`      | Modulus        | `10 % 3`  | `1`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation | `2 ** 3`  | `8`    |

### Example Usage

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a + b)   # Addition: 15
print(a - b)   # Subtraction: 5
print(a * b)   # Multiplication: 50
print(a / b)   # Division: 2.0
print(a // 3)  # Floor Division: 3
print(a % 3)   # Modulus: 1
print(2 ** 3)  # Exponentiation: 8
```

Each operator performs a specific arithmetic operation, making it easy to handle mathematical calculations in Python.
