# Operators in Python

Operators are fundamental building blocks in Python that allow you to perform various operations on data, such as calculations, comparisons, and logical evaluations. Understanding how operators work is essential for writing effective Python code.

## Types of Operators

- **Arithmetic Operators**: Used to perform mathematical operations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and more.
- **Logical Operators**: Used to combine conditional statements and evaluate logical relationships, such as `and`, `or`, and `not`.

Each operator has a specific purpose and usage. Mastering operators will help you write clear, concise, and efficient Python programs.
