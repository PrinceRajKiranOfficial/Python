# NumPy â€“ Numerical Python

NumPy (**Numerical Python**) is a powerful library in Python for numerical and scientific computing.  
It provides support for **multidimensional arrays**, **vectorized operations**, and mathematical functions such as **linear algebra, statistics, and more**.

---

## Why NumPy?

- If you want to store **small amounts of data**, simple Python **variables** or **lists** may be sufficient.  
- For **large amounts of data**, NumPy arrays are more **efficient** and **faster** than Python lists.  
- Accessing and manipulating data in lists can be complex, while NumPy arrays provide **simple and optimized indexing**.  
- Python supports only **basic single-dimensional arrays** by default, but NumPy allows the creation of **multidimensional arrays**.

## Features of NumPy

- **Multidimensional arrays (`ndarray`)**
- **Vectorized operations** (fast element-wise computations)
- **Mathematical functions** (trigonometry, statistics, algebra)
- **Broadcasting** (operations between arrays of different shapes)
- **Integration with other libraries** (Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)

## Installation

To install NumPy, use **pip**:

```bash
pip install numpy
