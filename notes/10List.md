# Python Lists

A **list** in Python is a collection of items with these key properties:

- **Ordered**: Each item has a defined position.
- **Mutable**: You can add, remove, or modify elements.
- **Duplicates allowed**: Lists can contain repeated values.
- **Mixed data types**: Elements can be integers, strings, floats, etc.

Lists are created using square brackets (`[]`).

**Example:**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = ["Python", 3.14, True, 42]
```
