# Six Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. Below are the six core pillars of OOP with brief explanations.

## 1. Class
A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of the object.
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def drive(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} {self.model} is driving.")
```

## 2. Object
An **object** is an instance of a class. It represents a specific implementation of the class blueprint.
```python
my_car = Car("Tesla", "Model S")
my_car.drive()
```

## 3. Inheritance
**Inheritance** allows one class (child) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent). This promotes code reuse.
```python
class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, battery_capacity):
        super().__init__(brand, model)
        self.battery_capacity = battery_capacity
```

## 4. Polymorphism
**Polymorphism** means the same function name can have different implementations depending on the object that calls it.
```python
def car_sound(car):
    car.drive()

car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
car2 = ElectricCar("Tesla", "Model 3", "75 kWh")

car_sound(car1)
car_sound(car2)
```

## 5. Encapsulation
**Encapsulation** is the practice of hiding internal details of a class and only exposing what is necessary. This is often achieved using private attributes and getter/setter methods.
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance
```

## 6. Abstraction
**Abstraction** is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only essential features. It can be achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius
```
