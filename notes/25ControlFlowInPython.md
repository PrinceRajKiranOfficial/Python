# CONTROL FLOW IN PYTHON

## What is Control Flow?

Control Flow refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated in a Python program.  

Python provides several control flow statements to help us make decisions and repeat actions.

**Control Flow Statements in Python:**
- `if`, `elif`, `else`
- `while`
- `for`
- `break`
- `continue`
- `pass`
