# Variables in Python

- Variables do not follow a sequence order.
- Variables are used to store data.
- Python is case sensitive.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
```

Here, `name` and `age` are variable names, and the `=` operator is used to assign values.

Python is a dynamically typed language, so you do not need to declare the datatype each time.
