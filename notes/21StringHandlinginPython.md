## String Handling in Python

A string is a sequence of characters in Python. Strings can be defined using single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) for multiline strings.

**Examples:**

```python
s1 = "Hello"
s2 = 'Hello'
s3 = '''This is a multiline string'''
```

In Python, strings are immutable. Once we create a string, we cannot change its elements.
