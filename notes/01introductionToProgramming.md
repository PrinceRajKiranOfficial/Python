# Introduction to Programming with Python

Python is a dynamic programming language. In Python, you do not need to declare data types explicitly; the type is determined by the most recent value assigned to a variable.

**Example:**
```python
A = 10
A = 2.0
A = True
A = None
print(A)
# Output: None
```
