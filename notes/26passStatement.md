# 8. Pass Statement in Python

The `pass` statement is used as a placeholder for future code or to define an empty block of code.  
It allows the program to run without throwing an error, even though no action is performed.

---

## When to Use `pass`
- As a placeholder in loops.
- In function or class definitions where the implementation will be added later.
- In conditional statements to avoid syntax errors.

---

## Example Code

```python
# Example 1: Pass in a loop
for i in range(5):
    pass  # Do nothing for now

# Example 2: Pass in a function
def future_function():
    pass  # Code to be added later
