## What is a Dictionary?

A **dictionary** in Python is an unordered, mutable collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are used to store data values like a map, where each key is unique.

### Key Characteristics

- **Unordered** (as of Python 3.6+, dictionaries maintain insertion order)
- **Mutable** (can be changed after creation)
- **Keys** must be unique and immutable
- **Values** can be of any data type
- **Fast lookups** using keys
